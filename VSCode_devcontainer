How to start a project in windows using dev container. 

I use a Windows laptop and I always struggle to find the right libraries to install and run. When using VSCode, Windows has a Linux extension which I have heavily used. But Azure extension may fail to run successful. This problem has become more prominent as I am working with Azure AI services and Python. Pythin traditionally has Anaconda and python environment which aim to achieve this objective. But even with python env I have struggled to get my project to run. So for Windows users its best to use VSCode Devcontainers.

1. Deploy Docker desktop and make sure its running 
2. Add devcontainer.json file inside it. Define the devcontainer.json file like below:


"name": "Azure Developer CLI",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.10-bullseye",
    "features": {
        // See https://containers.dev/features for list of features
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {
        },
        "ghcr.io/azure/azure-dev/azd:latest": {}
    },
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "GitHub.vscode-github-actions",
                "ms-azuretools.azure-dev",
                "ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions",
                "ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep",
                "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
                "promptflow.promptflow",
                "ms-python.python",
		        "ms-toolsai.vscode-ai",
		        "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
		        "redhat.vscode-yaml"
                // Include other VSCode language extensions if needed
                // Right click on an extension inside VSCode to add directly to devcontainer.json, or copy the extension ID
            ]
        }
    },
    "forwardPorts": [
        // Forward ports if needed for local development
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "",
    "remoteUser": "vscode",
    "hostRequirements": {
        "memory": "8gb"
    }
}

3. Once the file is saved, VSCode - View - Command Palette - Dec Container-Open Folder in Container and then point at the devcontainer.json. This will start the container.
